I've been wanting to get back to writing often for a long time. My old jekyll
based blog is slow and I'm not really using ruby anymore so I always forget the
commands. I'd like to host myself and don't want to be preaching on every post,
so medium or similar is out of the question.

So the main objective is to write and publish as often as possible. I do write
a fair bit for myself but I forget what I write. And I miss the conversations. There
are a few more technical objectives that I'll get to write about soon.

Every time I've decided to get back to writing I've ultimately gotten stuck over
what to use. I've decided on metalsmith as a simple starting point then build as I go.

So hello!
