I want to  document what I learn about publicly for 2 main reasons:

- To keep a log I can refer back to.
- To force myself to write in a way that is understandable to others, which will
  also benefit me in the future.

I've found the best time to document something is around the time it clicks,
either before it does or right after. In that sense I'm making the act of
writing here as frictionless as possible. Wherever I am in my computer I should
be able to quickly create or edit a note and publish it. I have a few ideas on
how to do that. So far what i've implemented 2:

- Create a Notes folder in my home directory with only the markdown files.
  Whenever I open the finder I can see it without the noise of all the blogging
  engine.
- Create a `note` script that, from any location on the terminal, will get me to
  that directory, create a markdown fie ith prepopulated frontmatter and open .
