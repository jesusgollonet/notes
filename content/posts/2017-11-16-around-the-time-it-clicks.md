title: Around the time it clicks

I want to  document what I learn about publicly for 2 main reasons:

- To keep a log I can refer back to.
- To force myself to write in a way that is understandable to others, which will
  also benefit me in the future.

I've found the best time to document something is around the time it clicks,
either before it does or right after. In that sense I'm striving to make the act
of writing here as frictionless as possible. Wherever I am in my computer I
should be able to quickly create or edit a note and publish it. I have a few
ideas on how to do that. So far what i've implemented 2:

- The list of notes lives in the `~/Notes` folder in my home directory.
  Whenever I open the finder I can see it without the noise of the blogging
  engine.
- I have a `note` script that, from any location on the terminal, will create in
  that directory a markdown file with prepopulated frontmatter and open it in
  vim.
