I've started to take stanford's Introduction to Computer Networking. Here are
some references I intend to use in order to do the course:

- Udacity's Networking for Web Developers. A practical course more focused on
tools than principles. Should be a good counterpoint. They offer a second part
which I feel is too advanced for the moment.
- Recommended bibliography + classic networking books.
- Let's code a TCP/IP stack: Good practice of both C programming and Networking 
- Beej's guide to network programming (same)
- Node.js Net module. A good opportunity to explore node.js in a lower level
than usual
- Opsschool chapter on networking: Pragmatic and succint tone.
