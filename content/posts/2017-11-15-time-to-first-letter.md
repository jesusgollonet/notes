I have a love/hate relationship with static site generators for blogging. I'm
all for using my text editor instead of any web interface for writing, but I've
noticed they raise what I call the 'barrier to activation' or TTFL \* too high. To a
point where, if I'm not writing often, the amount of steps, decisions, and
potential failure cases involved makes me lose interest in what I'm thinking
about before I get to starting to write.

Compare the experience of creating a new post:

### Traditional web based CMS

- Type a url on your web browser
- Maybe log in
- Click on create a new post

### Static site generator

- Find the folder in your computer with your blog engine (assuming the project
  is cloned, otherwise do that)
- Find the way to run the engine locally (assuming you have the dependencies
  installed, and the stack the project was running on is working and up to
  date).
- Find the command to make a new post, if you have one. Or create a markdown
  file manually. Make sure you follow the conventions of whatever framework
  you're using.

If writing is something you do very often or your site generator is very close
to what you use in your everyday life, both options can look very similar, but
otherwise the amount of decisions and potential failure points makes the task of
writing a post less and less likely to be completed.

For this site I'm working on a few strategies to alleviate the shortcomings of
SSGs. My solutions will never be as universal as URIs and buttons, but should
make the TTFL way faster.

\* This is only a half joke
